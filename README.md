This is a personal reminder app built in Vanilla JavaScript from scratch.

It allows users to 
* add or remove to-do tasks
* mark any tasks as done
* check tasks for a specific date
* filter tasks by tag(category)
* add or remove custom tag

This app also includes two API calls to get current weather based on user's location and news headlines.
